# Pacman-ish-game
Game made using Java and the processing module. It's basically the same concept as pacman, just with a couple of additional features such as teleporation.
There are only two levels right now, but more can be added very simply by just copying the levels text files and altering the maps as you please, then also
updating the config file.

Downloading all the files into the same directory and then using 'gradle run' in terminal should run the game.
